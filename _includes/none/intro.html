In this short workshop, we will present the existing ways to write Python code
to interact with an OMERO server. This allows for programmatic access to
image pixels and metadata related to images stored in the OMERO platform. 
Students should be comfortable with basic Python and interested in writing 
code to automate image analysis and/or data management.
